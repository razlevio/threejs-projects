# threejs-projects
A repository for storing a collection of Three.js projects showcasing the use of Three.js library in creating 3D graphics and animations. Three.js is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create 3D graphics and animations in the browser. It provides a simple, yet powerful, API for creating and manipulating 3D objects and scenes with just a few lines of code.

### Repository Overview
This repository is intended to serve as a portfolio for my projects created using Three.js. As I progress in my learning journey, I will add new projects to this repository and document my growth and development.

The repository contains a separate directory for each project, along with a brief description of the project, the technologies used, and a screenshot or demo of the project in action.

### Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory of the project you want to run. Each project may have its own dependencies and setup instructions, so be sure to follow the README file in each project's directory.
